Write a program that allows the user to repeatedly
enter numbers. Consider that the user has entered
all the numbers when he/she enters -99
After the user has entered all numbers, the user should 
be allowed to repeatedly look for numbers among the numbers entered.
The program halts when the user enters -99 at this point.
